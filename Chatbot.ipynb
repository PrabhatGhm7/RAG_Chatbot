Yellow Flag: It is an indication of caution to the drivers to go slow due to some accident or hazard on the track or due to rain. 3. Red Flag: It is an indication of danger, especially bad weather conditions and signals the drivers to stop or return to the pit immediately, depending on the situation. 4. Red & Yellow Striped Flag : It is displayed at the end of free practice sessions (Friday & Saturday) on the last corner and pit straight, indicating to the drivers that other drivers are engaged in practice on pit straight. Instruction Flags These flags communicate with only one driver at a time and are of 5 types – 1. Black Flag: It is shown to impose penalty when a driver has broken some rules and instruct the driver to get back to the pit. 2. Black Flag with Orange Circle: It indicates that a car is being asked to return to the cockpit due to technical problems like fuel leak, water leak or oil leak, that might interfere with the proceedings of the race.\n",
